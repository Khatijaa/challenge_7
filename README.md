# Challenge_7
## Project Overview
Build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

---

## Technologies

The application is in python and is uing the following libraries:

* [numpy](https://github.com/ElisonSherton/Numpy-Explained) - For mathematical operations.

* [pandas](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/index.html) - For data analysis.

* [hvplot.pandas](https://github.com/holoviz/hvplot) - For advanced graphs.

* [sqlalchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy) - For creating database. 


The operating system used in creating the application is Windows 10 64 bit. The application that used to code in notebook is Jupyter and then tested in Gitbash and Terminal. 

I created a engine for the application

The output file was read by:

```python
engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(database_connection_string)
```

## Installation Guide

1. Open Gitbach or terminal and go ito the folder where you want to place the files.
2. Click on the blue "code" button which will allow you to clone.![<Code button in Github>]()
3. Then click on SSH or HTTPS as a clone method depending on if you have the SSH key setup. You will copy the link. You will then type "git clone" in Gitback or Terminal. Then paste the ssh or https information and press enter.
4. Next type "git pull" command in Temrinal or GitBash to pull the repository from the remote Github repository to a local directory on your computer.
5. You have access to the application. Also there will be all the python files that the application is depended on,  plus the excel file.
